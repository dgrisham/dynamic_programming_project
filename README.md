From Eric:

I've added code for a palindrome-finder that should work. It takes a given input
sequence, reverses it, and then runs the algorithm to find the largest
subsequence in both strings. If you have the textbook, it's all in pages
280-291. 

To run the code, you can make 'run' an executable and './run' (this file is
default to run the example provided in the project handout, and we get a
subsequence as long as the "answer") Alternatively, 'make all' and then
'./exe_palindrome (whatever string you want)' should work.  I will probably
update my code in the next few days and make it prettier; feel free to help if
you want.
